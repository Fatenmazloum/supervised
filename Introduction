* Machine Learning (ML) is the first level of AI
It's a set of algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

There are two main types of ML:
Supervised Learning:
- Learns from labeled data.
- You give the model both the input data and the correct answers, so it learns to predict outcomes.

Example: Predicting the price of a house based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.

Unsupervised Learning:
- Learns from unlabeled data.
- The model finds patterns or groupings on its own.

Example: Clustering similar customers into groups for targeted marketing.

* Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML
It uses neural networks, especially deep (multi-layered) ones, and is very powerful for:

Images

Text

Audio

Video

Common Deep Learning Models:
- CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) – used for images

- Transformers – used for language tasks and now also vision tasks

*LLMs (Large Language Models)
LLMs are deep learning models that use transformers to understand and generate human language.
They’re trained to predict the next token (word/part of word) in a sentence.

Example: GPT (like ChatGPT) is an LLM.

* Transformers (the architecture)
Originally invented by Google (in the paper "Attention is All You Need") — not a Python library.
But yes, there is a Transformers Python library by Hugging Face, which makes it easy to load and use pretrained transformer models like GPT, BERT, etc.

* Computer Vision (CV)
CV is a field in AI focused on teaching machines to understand images and videos.

It’s not a model or algorithm by itself — it's a goal or problem area.

CV uses DL models like:
CNNs – for recognizing or classifying images

YOLO (You Only Look Once) – for detecting and predicting objects inside images-ready to use

UNet / Mask R-CNN – for segmenting images (pixel-by-pixel tasks)
